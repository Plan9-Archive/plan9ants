These are very slightly patched files to help the tools interoperate
with the 'rootless' environment.

the rc simply sets the location of the rcmain initialization file to
/boot/rcmain rather than /rc/lib/rcmain.

the factotum adds the -x option, which refuses to mount cs on /net.
This is to prevent the loss of the root filesystem from blocking the
ability of factotum to auth by causing cs to time out while trying to
read from a dead filedescriptor.  The -x option should be used in
combination with the -a option to speficy a chosen auth server for
access to the service namespace.

wranenadb.c modifies wrarena to fix the handling of clump offsets in
plan9port.  In default plan 9 the bug does not exist and seems related
to the new arena number counting logic in the p9p version.  In fixing
the clump offset handling however I might have broken the
arena-offsets, because the origin of the bug seemed to lie in a
confusion between those variables in the code.  Figuring out what is
going on here in detail and checking the behavior of this tool in
standard plan 9 is a to-do.  Added now the -n option to specificy
which arena to use and made it terminate after reading just that
number arena.  Plan 9 port specific.  Investigated the code more and
discovered that plan9port seems to diverge from plan9 and the offset
trouble may be related.  Switched main venti to native plan 9 and now
using slightly mofidied nativer wrarena with additional clump info
printed.

retired mods were things that seemed necessary or a good idea
previously, but I am no longer using.
