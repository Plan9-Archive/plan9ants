INSTALLING README INDEX GUIDE - intro documentation and help

build - script to build all components of the namespace toolkit

bootdir.extras/ - central point for main rootless boot tools

	bootpaq - this is compiled into the kernel and contains tools
	from root/lib/_mkpaq

	factotum grio hub hubfs hubshell rc rcmain - programs compiled
	into boot

	namespace namespace.saveterm namespace.standard - customized
	namespace files adapted to the rootless environment

	plan9rc - the main namespace launcher script which controls
	boot and launching additional namespaces

	ramskel - sets up the ramfs skeleton and optional tgzfs

	initskel - acts as a mini-cpurc for the rootless environment
	and its network services

	save9cfg - script to save variables used in plan9.ini and by
	plan9rc and initskel

	skel.tar - this is the tar of the bootdir.extras/root
	subdirectory

	root/ - this is what becomes the skeleton ramfs used in the
	early boot environment.  it contains mostly empty directories
	and a /usr/bootes template user directory.

cfg/ - contains configuration files and utility scripts, as well as
the mkpaq and toolcopy scripts which can be used to customize the
contents of the early boot namespace

compiletemp/ - used by the build script to compile things in, after
running build the new 9pcram.gz kernel will be found here

diffs/ - these files show the diffs between the modified ANTS files
and the base 9front distribution

doc/ - documentation for bootup, namespace scripts, fossil/venti
tools, plan9.ini/plan9rc/initskel variables

	ants.ps - please page ants.ps to read the full Giant ANTS
	paper

	examples/ - contains saved output of tests and demonstrations

	modified.manpages/ - modified documentation for boot (8) and
	proc (3)

	textdoc/ - older plaintext forms of documentation prior to
	manpage writing

	PLAN9.INI - this file is a plan9.ini which works with the
	stock fossil install of the bell labs .iso and the 9pcram.gz
	kernel

frontmods/ - 9front patches and modifications. Subdirs get bound over
	base directories during build 9front
	
	grio/ - 9front version of customized rio

grio/ - labs modified rio with hubfs integration and other features

hubfs/ - a 'screen' replacement as a 9p fs, also general purpose
	network transparent pipe muxing for grids

patched/ - contains the source code for modifications of standard
plan9 programs adapted to the rootless environment

root/ - used to build the tools.tgz.  It contains additional chunks of
information used to provide a slightly richer plan 9 environment.

scripts/ - contains the non-bootup related namespace manipulation and
fossil/venti maintenance scripts.

src.9.boot/ - labs modified files from /sys/src/9/boot.  The build script
binds these modified files over the parallel directory.

src.9.pc/ - the labs 9pcram kernel configuration file and its mkfile

src.9.port/ - labs version pf modified files for writable /proc/ns and
the rootless boot.  These two mods are separable if desired.  The ns
mod affects chan.c devproc.c and portfns.h.  The boot related files
are devroot.c and devsrv.c
